# Typescript Backend Projects

## Description

This repository contains a collection of personal projects that I have developed using Typescript for the backend. The projects are organized in different folders, each one containing a different project. The projects are:

- [**`Personal Budget 1`**](./personal-budget1): A simple personal budget application that allows the user to add, remove, and edit expenses and incomes. The application also shows the total balance and the balance of each category.
- [**`User CRUD v1`**](./user-crud-v1): A simple CRUD API that allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting users with Postgres SQL database. The user data consists of a user's name and email.
- [**`Prisma Postgres Demo`**](./prisma-postgres-demo): A simple CRUD API that allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting users with Prisma ORM and Postgres SQL database. The user data consists of a user's name and email.
- [**`Personal Budget 2`**](./personal-budget-2): A simple personal budget application that allows the user to add, remove, and edit expenses and incomes. The application also shows the total balance and the balance of each category. This version of the application uses node-postgres `pg` and Postgres SQL database.
- [**`Swagger Demo`**](./swagger-demo): A demo project to use of Swagger with Express.js along with TypeScript.
- [**`Authentation Demo`**](./authen-demo): A simple authentication API that allows users to register, login, and logout. The API uses JWT for authentication and authorization.
- [**`Photo Caption`**](./photo-caption): A backend for a platform where users can participate in a photo caption contest. The server hosts few images and provides endpoint to authenticate and authorize users, upload images, and submit captions for the images.

## Technologies

The projects are developed using the following technologies:

- **Typescript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows the execution of JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- **Nodemon**: A utility that monitors for any changes in the source code of a Node.js application and automatically restarts the server.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Fastify**: A web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture.
- **Postgres**: An open-source relational database management system that uses and extends the SQL language.
- **Prisma**: A modern database toolkit that simplifies database access for Node.js and TypeScript applications.
- **Swagger**: An open-source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services.

## Recommended Development Tools

The following tools are recommended for the development of the projects:

- **Visual Studio Code**: A source-code editor developed by Microsoft that includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
- **pnpm**: A fast, disk space efficient package manager that uses hard links and symlinks to save one version of a module only ever once on a disk.
- **Postman**: A collaboration platform for API development that allows the user to design, mock, document, monitor, and test APIs.
