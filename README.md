# Typescript Backend Projects

## Description

This repository contains a collection of personal projects that I have developed using Typescript for the backend. The projects are organized in different folders, each one containing a different project. The projects are:

- [**`Personal Budget 1`**](https://github.com/sreeharsha-rav/typescript-projects/tree/main/personal-budget1): A simple personal budget application that allows the user to add, remove, and edit expenses and incomes. The application also shows the total balance and the balance of each category.
- [**`User CRUD v1`**](./user-crud-v1): A simple CRUD API that allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting users with Postgres SQL database. The user data consists of a user's name and email.

## Technologies

The projects are developed using the following technologies:

- **Typescript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows the execution of JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Postgres**: An open-source relational database management system that uses and extends the SQL language.

## Recommended Development Tools

The following tools are recommended for the development of the projects:

- **Visual Studio Code**: A source-code editor developed by Microsoft that includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
- **pnpm**: A fast, disk space efficient package manager that uses hard links and symlinks to save one version of a module only ever once on a disk.
- **Postman**: A collaboration platform for API development that allows the user to design, mock, document, monitor, and test APIs.
